                Digital Education in India is the way forward to learning and gaining
                knowledge through the means of technology and digital devices.
                COVID-19 pandemic had briefly disrupted the school education system in
                India. Since the 1st lockdown in March 2020, all the states have
                responded to the COVID-19 situation with speed and innovation. The
                existing digital resources were leveraged to maintain continuity in
                studentâ€™s education. The traditional way of learning offers students
                the little scope of engagement as the dynamics of a traditional
                classroom comprise students, textbooks, and educators for learning.
                While on the other hand, the digital education system provides a wide
                variety of options for the students to learn from. The limitless
                availability of images and video content, virtual reality, interactive
                sessions, and many more make the digital learning method more
                engrossing and smooth for students to grasp.
